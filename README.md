# Fictional characters database


This is my third and last project for Yandex.Lyceum, and also the one I'm most proud of.

**Tools and libraries I used:**
1. Flask;
2. SQLite databases;
3. HTML, Bootstrap and simple CSS to style pages.

__Stuff I've implemented in this project:__
- signup system;
- password hashes;
- login system;
- modifying the database - adding, editing, deleting the articles;
- template-based HTML pages;
- user pages;
- article pages, article links generation;
- articles overview;
- creating comments on a page;
- editing comments.
